  </ul></li>

</ul>

To write your SQL statements, I would suggest using a free online tool, <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/">SQL Fiddle</a>. You can write the Create Table and Insert statements in the Schema Panel and then run your query to accomplish the last part of the problem in the other panel.
